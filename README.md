## Linked List
### Singly Linked List

Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.
Why Linked List?
Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations.
1) The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage.
2) Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted.

Advantages over arrays
1) Dynamic size
2) Ease of insertion/deletion

Drawbacks:
1) Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation. Read about it here.
2) Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
3) Not cache friendly. Since array elements are contiguous locations, there is locality of reference which is not there in case of linked lists.

Representation:
A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head is NULL.
Each node in a list consists of at least two parts:
1) data
2) Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node

Example : 
1->2->3->NULL

### Circular Linked List

Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.
Example : 
  1->2->3->4->5->Back to 1
Advantages of Circular Linked Lists:
1) Any node can be a starting point. We can traverse the whole list by starting from any point. We just need to stop when the first visited node is visited again.

2) Useful for implementation of queue. Unlike this implementation, we donâ€™t need to maintain two pointers for front and rear if we use circular linked list. We can maintain a pointer to the last inserted node and front can always be obtained as next of last.

3) Circular lists are useful in applications to repeatedly go around the list. For example, when multiple applications are running on a PC, it is common for the operating system to put the running applications on a list and then to cycle through them, giving each of them a slice of time to execute, and then making them wait while the CPU is given to another application. It is convenient for the operating system to use a circular list so that when it reaches the end of the list it can cycle around to the front of the list.

4) Circular Doubly Linked Lists are used for implementation of advanced data structures like Fibonacci Heap.

### Doubly Linked List

A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.

Advantages over singly linked list 
1) A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward direction. 
2) The delete operation in DLL is more efficient if pointer to the node to be deleted is given. 
3) We can quickly insert a new node before a given node. 
In singly linked list, to delete a node, pointer to the previous node is needed. To get this previous node, sometimes the list is traversed. In DLL, we can get the previous node using previous pointer. 
 

 
Disadvantages over singly linked list 
1) Every node of DLL Require extra space for an previous pointer. It is possible to implement DLL with single pointer though (See this and this). 
2) All operations require an extra pointer previous to be maintained. For example, in insertion, we need to modify previous pointers together with next pointers. For example in following functions for insertions at different positions, we need 1 or 2 extra steps to set previous pointer.


### Stack

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

Mainly the following three basic operations are performed in the stack:

Push: Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
Pop: Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
Peek or Top: Returns top element of stack.
isEmpty: Returns true if stack is empty, else false.

How to understand a stack practically? 
There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider the simple example of plates stacked over one another in a canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow LIFO/FILO order.

push(), pop(), isEmpty() and peek() all take O(1) time. We do not run any loop in any of these operations.

Applications of stack:

Balancing of symbols
Infix to Postfix /Prefix conversion
Redo-undo features at many places like editors, photoshop.
Forward and backward feature in web browsers
Used in many algorithms like Tower of Hanoi, tree traversals, stock span problem, histogram problem.
Backtracking is one of the algorithm designing technique .Some example of back tracking are Knight-Tour problem,N-Queen problem,find your way through maze and game like chess or checkers in all this problems we dive into someway if that way is not efficient we come back to the previous state and go into some another path. To get back from current state we need to store the previous state for that purpose we need stack.
In Graph Algorithms like Topological Sorting and Strongly Connected Components
In Memory management any modern  computer uses stack as the primary-management for a running purpose.Each program that is running in a computer system has its own memory allocations
String reversal is also a another application of stack.Here one by one each character get inserted into the stack.So the first character of string is on the bottom of the stack and the last element of string is on the top of stack. After Performing the pop operations on stack we get string in reverse order .


Implementation: 
There are two ways to implement a stack: 

Using array
Using linked list
