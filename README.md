## Linked List
### Singly Linked List

Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.
Why Linked List?
Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations.
1) The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage.
2) Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted.

Advantages over arrays
1) Dynamic size
2) Ease of insertion/deletion

Drawbacks:
1) Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation. Read about it here.
2) Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
3) Not cache friendly. Since array elements are contiguous locations, there is locality of reference which is not there in case of linked lists.

Representation:
A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head is NULL.
Each node in a list consists of at least two parts:
1) data
2) Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node

Example : 
1->2->3->NULL

### Circular Linked List

Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.
Example : 
  1->2->3->4->5->Back to 1
Advantages of Circular Linked Lists:
1) Any node can be a starting point. We can traverse the whole list by starting from any point. We just need to stop when the first visited node is visited again.

2) Useful for implementation of queue. Unlike this implementation, we donâ€™t need to maintain two pointers for front and rear if we use circular linked list. We can maintain a pointer to the last inserted node and front can always be obtained as next of last.

3) Circular lists are useful in applications to repeatedly go around the list. For example, when multiple applications are running on a PC, it is common for the operating system to put the running applications on a list and then to cycle through them, giving each of them a slice of time to execute, and then making them wait while the CPU is given to another application. It is convenient for the operating system to use a circular list so that when it reaches the end of the list it can cycle around to the front of the list.

4) Circular Doubly Linked Lists are used for implementation of advanced data structures like Fibonacci Heap.

### Doubly Linked List

A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.

Advantages over singly linked list 
1) A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward direction. 
2) The delete operation in DLL is more efficient if pointer to the node to be deleted is given. 
3) We can quickly insert a new node before a given node. 
In singly linked list, to delete a node, pointer to the previous node is needed. To get this previous node, sometimes the list is traversed. In DLL, we can get the previous node using previous pointer. 
 

 
Disadvantages over singly linked list 
1) Every node of DLL Require extra space for an previous pointer. It is possible to implement DLL with single pointer though (See this and this). 
2) All operations require an extra pointer previous to be maintained. For example, in insertion, we need to modify previous pointers together with next pointers. For example in following functions for insertions at different positions, we need 1 or 2 extra steps to set previous pointer.
